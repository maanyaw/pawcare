4 System Architecture
The deign specifications define the workflow and technical structure of the EEG-based Emotion recogonition system.This chapter demonstrates the overall system architecture, design-level diagrams, and conceptual interface design.The specifications ensure that each stage of the project, starting from raw EEG acquisition to deep learning–based classification, is clearly represented in terms of design and functionality.

4.1
The overall architecture of the proposed system is divided into five stages:
EEG Data Acquisition
The dataset used is the Naturalistic Music EEG Dataset – Rhythm Pilot (NMED-RP)
.

It included dense-array EEG recordings from five healthy participants who listened to 16 musical excerpts (Even, Swing, Syncopated, Polyrhythmic).

EEG signals were recorded using an EGI 128-channel system with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz
.

After each excerpt, participants rated enjoyment, perceived rhythmic complexity, and ease of finding the beat (scale 1–9).
